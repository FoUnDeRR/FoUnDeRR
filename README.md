# Who am I?
> My name is `Ranumitha`, Sailing from [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka) as a _15 year old_ full-stack developer. My hobbies often revolve around programming, sports, and other life activities. I have five rabbits and two turtles to provide love and care for them which relax my mind. Loves listening to pop music, here's [my 2024 spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1y4DzCJVfeCzMk3VqNJaH1?si=eb1e8518c9f349e1&nd=1&dlsi=d3b0aa40ca654613). 

> I used to be a small content creator back in the day, but now I'm smashing keyboard keys to develop experiences and play games for fun. I might rework on my YouTube channel in the future, who knows :shipit:. Making discord apps using discord.js and javascript satisfies me a lot, and by doing that I learn more things about both Discord and javascript.
